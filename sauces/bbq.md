# BBQ Sauce

This is just a recipe I came up with to use up extra tomato paste. I used this as a dip, not actually for BBQing

To taste:

- tomato paste
- backstrap molasses
- maple syrup
- red wine vinegar
- dijon mustard (I use beer mustard)
- chipotle powder or adobo sauce
- tonkatsu sauce or okonomiyaki sauce
- liquid smoke (I use mesquite)
- salt
- garlic powder
- enough water to get consistency you want
