# Restaurant-style Mexican Escabeche

Combining the best of various recipes I've found online after many experiments to get what tastes to me like the stuff they have at restaurants. With 2 variants. Makes enough pickles to fill one smaller pasta sauce jar.

Make the brine, making sure to dissolve the sugar and salt fully:
- 2/3 cup distilled vinegar
- 1/4 cup water
- 1 tbsp sugar
- 2 tsp salt

Put these in the jar:
- 1 bay leaf
- 5-10 peppercorns
- 1 tsp Mexican oregano (if you don't have that, substitute with marjoram)
- 1 garlic clove, bruised with the side of a knife

Prepare these whichever variant you go with:
- 1-2 large jalape単os, cores removed and sliced into rings

Variant 1, crunchy veggie
- 1/2 white onion, sliced thinly
- 1 large carrot, sliced into 1/4in. slices OR an equivalent amount of cauliflower broken into chunks (or double this recipe and include both)

Alternatingly place jalape単o rings, onion and veggies in the jar, packing as tightly as you can until you fill up the jar. There may be excess of the vegetable, but ensure that all the jalape単o and onion makes its way in. Carefully pour in the brine and close the jar. Within 2-3 days, the pickles should start being delicious. Eat within 2 weeks.

Variant 2, pink onions
- 1 whole white or red onion, sliced thinly
- 1 radish, sliced thinly (optional if using red onion)

Slowly sweat the onion, radish and jalape単o in a nonstick pan over low heat for 10 minutes. Make sure to stir and keep the pan from overheating so that the veggies only soften and don't burn. There is no need to add oil. Allow to cool for a few minutes, then place in the jar, pour in the brine and refrigerate. These pickles will start being usable after a day, but reach their peak flavor close to 3 days afterward. Eat within 2 weeks.
