# Caesar Salad

As long as you get the ratios right (which I haven't figured out, I just added until it tasted right), this works as a veganized version of the original Caesar salad recipe:

- ground irigoma
- nutritional yeast
- vegan mayo or silken tofu
- lime juice
- olive oil
- minced garlic
- minced capers
- coarsely ground black pepper
- dijon mustard
- tonkatsu sauce

Thoroughly toss into romaine and add some really good, big homemade croutons on top. Maybe some crunched up toasted pepitas too.
