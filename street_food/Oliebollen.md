Dutch yeast donuts. New Year's Eve treat!

- 250g flour
- 250g milk, buttermilk or water (almond milk works well)
- 60g raisins, soaked in water
- 1 tbsp sugar
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 7g dry yeast
- powdered sugar, cinnamon sugar, or garnish of your choice

Ensure liquid is at room temperature. Soak raisins in water for at least 15 minutes, then drain. Mix ingredients together and let ferment in warm place for at least an hour, longer in a cool place.

Heat oil to 180°C/350°F, then deep fry hunks of dough for 3 minutes. They should automatically roll over on their own but flip if they don't do that halfway through. Drain on towell. Don't worry if the shapes are funny, these are hard to shape right. Garnish with powdered sugar or cinnamon sugar.
