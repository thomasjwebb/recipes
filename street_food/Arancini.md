# Arancini

Sicilian deep fried rice balls.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup arborio rice
- 2 cups broth and/or water from tomatoes
- 1 tsp saffron
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- bread crumbs
- light olive oil, for frying

Use a good rice cooker (Zoojirushi, other Japanese or Korean brands that use fuzzy logic) and put in the ingredients and cook using porridge mode. Otherwise, cook like you usually do for risotto. When done, form into balls (Western Sicily style) or cones (Eastern Sicily). You may put in fillings before doing so (see fillings, below). Roll around in bread crumbs to coat with bread crumbs. Deep fry until golden, sprinkle with salt.

## Fillings

- tomato sauce, ground beef or soy crumbles, peas
- mushrooms and cheese
- pine nuts and raisins
