# Æbleskiver

(This is a rough recipe, many specific amounts are missing still)

Use the [dough for oliebollen](Oliebollen.md), omit the raisins and add more water to get to thicker pancake batter consistency. Let sit until it starts bubbling. You may use baking powder instead of yeast if you don't have time to wait for that.

Apple sauce:
Shred apples and heat in pan with some ground cardamom and ground cinnamon until it's a nice paste-like consistency.

Heat and brush æbleskiver (or takoyaki, for smaller æbleskiver) pan with oil. Fill with batter to just below top. Put in some of the applesauce, then top off with a little more of the batter, enough to cover the applesauce. With more perfectly spherical pans, turn halfway over allowing the batter to spill downward after the bottom is cooked, then turn again after that is cooked to get a spherical æbleskive. For squashed sphere shape pan, flip over entirely and when both sides are lightly browned, flip on its side to help continue cooking the inside. Serve with powdered sugar. Traditionally served on Christmas, but great any day of the year!

Variations:
- "Solvang style" - omit the apples and top with raspberry jam and the sugar
- "American breakfast style" - put chopped pecans in the batter and omit the applesauce, and serve with maple syrup instead of powdered sugar. Serve with a side of bacon, coffee with whiskey in it and a gun.
- "Æbleskiver-style Poffertjes" - use the dough in a poffertje pan and serve with the applesauce and powdered sugar on top
