dry:
- 4g dry yeast
- 30g date sugar
- 5g salt

Variation: Anpanman anpan

Omit the kurogoma and put three balls in a row on top of larger ball with anko inside. Bake. Draw anpanman's face (mouth, eyes, eyebrows) with frosting. I made frosting with cocoa powder, powdered sugar, tiny bit of soymilk and vanilla extract
