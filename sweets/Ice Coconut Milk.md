# Ice Coconut Milk

Every bit as creamy as ice cream. You can make this even creamier by using coconut cream instead of coconut milk (you can take the cream from the top of coconut milk cans that have been sitting awhile).

- 1 can (14oz) coconut milk
- 3/4 cup sugar
- 1/3 cup water
- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract

1. Boil sugar in water, stirring constantly to make a syrup. Allow to cool.
2. Mix syrup with coconut milk and extract
3. Process in an ice cream maker. I like antique hand-cranked ones or my kitchenaid attachment for more convenience/less work.

## Variations

- Use pandan extract instead of vanilla
- Add peaches or mangoes
