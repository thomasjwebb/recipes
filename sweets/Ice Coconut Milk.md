# Ice Coconut Milk

Every bit as creamy as ice cream. You can make this even creamier by using coconut cream instead of coconut milk (you can take the cream from the top of coconut milk cans that have been sitting awhile).

- 1 can (14oz) coconut milk
- 3/8 cup sugar
- 1/3 cup water
- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract

1. Boil sugar in water, stirring constantly to make a syrup. Allow to cool.
2. Mix syrup with coconut milk and extract
3. Process in an ice cream maker. I like antique hand-cranked ones or my kitchenaid attachment for more convenience/less work.
4. Put into freezer (for kitchenaid attachment) or pile a pyramid of ice on top (for old-fashioned ice cream maker) and give it time to solidify

## Variations

- Use pandan extract instead of vanilla
- Add peaches or mangoes

## Variation - Spumoni

Follow this recipe three times with different mix-ins each time, and spread evenly in a layer in a mini-loaf pan into freezer for step 4. I usually do these as layers:

- Cocoa powder and crunched up dark chocolate
- Avocado blended into the batter and crunched up pistachio
- Fresh cherries, chopped

This should create distinct, brilliantly-colored brown, green and pink layers. A nice coconut spumoni!
