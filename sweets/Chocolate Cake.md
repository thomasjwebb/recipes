Instructions:

1. Brew coffee. Even cheap coffee is okay. Make it as strong or weak as you like it for the flavor.

2. Heat oven to 163°C/325°F. Oil the cake pan.

3. In a small bowl, mix some of the coffee and the cocoa powder. Make sure the cocoa powder dissolves

4. In a large bowl, mix some of the sugar, oil, shredded apple, and corn starch together.

5. Beat for 1-2 minutes. It should feel like something you did put egg in.

6. Mix 3 into 5.

7. Mix vanilla essence, almond essence and brandy into the mix

8. Put in the flour, sifted, baking powder, baking soda and salt.

9. Mix the flour and the cocoa mix together well for 1-2 minutes.

10. Pour mixture into a mold and place in the preheated oven to bake for 45-55 minutes.

11. After 45 minutes, test with wooden stick to see if the center is cooked or not.

12. When the cake is done, let it sit for 20 minutes.

13. Turn the cake out from the mold onto a plate.

14. (this isn't a direct translation since it's easier to say it in English than the metaphorical way she's saying it) Sprinkle powdered sugar into the top of the cake before you eat so it looks cute.
