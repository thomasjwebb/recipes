# Rookworst

This is a work in progress.. still trying to get the ratios right. Based on [this recipe](http://zuiversap.info/2015/10/15/vegan-rookworstjes/) with some modifications. I'm not sure of European can, cup, teaspoon, etc. sizes.

Ingredients:

- 1 can of cannellini beans (keep the liquid)
- 1 cup wheat gluten
- 1 tbsp oil
- 1 tsp ginger powder
- 1 tsp ground nutmeg
- 1 tsp ground coriander
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- dash of pepper
- 1 tsp chipotle powder
- 1 tbsp sugar or syrup (maple syrup must be good..)
- 1 tbsp lemon juice

Blend all ingredients except gluten together in a blender. Work in the gluten until it makes a workable dough. Add more gluten or more water to get it the right consistency, not too sticky. Form into sausage logs, wrap in foil and steam for 45 minutes. Let sit for at least a half an hour afterward before frying, grilling, etc.
